Usage
-----------

First, make sure you have Python 2.6 or 2.7.

    $ python --version
    Python 2.6.8
    
Install Shadowsocks.

    pip install shadowsocks
    
Create a file named `config.json`, with the following content.

    {
        "server":"my_server_ip",
        "server_port":8388,
        "local_port":1080,
        "password":"barfoo!",
        "timeout":600,
        "method":"table"
    }

Explaination of the fields:

    server          your server IP (IPv4/IPv6), notice that your server will listen to this IP
    server_port     server port
    local_port      local port
    password        a password used to encrypt transfer
    timeout         in seconds
    method          encryption method, "bf-cfb", "aes-256-cfb", "des-cfb", "rc4", etc. Default is table, which is not secure. "aes-256-cfb" is recommended

`cd` into the directory of `config.json`. Run `ssserver` on your server. To run it in the background, run
`nohup ssserver > log &`.

On your client machine, run `sslocal`.

Change the proxy setting in your browser into

    protocol: socks5
    hostname: 127.0.0.1
    port:     your local_port

**Notice: If you want to use encryption method other than "table", please install M2Crypto (See Encryption Section).**

It's recommended to use shadowsocks with AutoProxy or Proxy SwitchySharp.

Command line args
------------------

You can use args to override settings from `config.json`.

    sslocal -s server_name -p server_port -l local_port -k password -m bf-cfb
    ssserver -p server_port -k password -m bf-cfb
    ssserver -c /etc/shadowsocks/config.json

Encryption
------------

Default encryption method table, which is not secure, is not recommended. Please use "aes-256-cfb" or "bf-cfb". "rc4" is not secure, either, please don't use it.

List of all encryption methods:

- aes-128-cfb
- aes-192-cfb
- aes-256-cfb
- bf-cfb
- camellia-128-cfb
- camellia-192-cfb
- camellia-256-cfb
- cast5-cfb
- des-cfb
- idea-cfb
- rc2-cfb
- rc4
- seed-cfb
- table

**If you want to use encryption method other than "table", please install [M2Crypto](http://chandlerproject.org/Projects/MeTooCrypto).**

Ubuntu:

    apt-get install python-m2crypto

Others:

    apt-get install openssl-dev swig
    pip install M2Crypto

Please notice that some encryption methods are not available on some environments.

Performance
------------

You may use -d option to enable SMART DRIRECT feature. If SMART DIRECT is enabled, connection will be established directly to destination IPs in China.

    python local.py -d

You may want to install gevent for better performance.

    $ sudo apt-get install python-gevent

Or:

    $ sudo apt-get install libevent-dev python-pip
    $ sudo pip install gevent
